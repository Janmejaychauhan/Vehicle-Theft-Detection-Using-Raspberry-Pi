In recent years, vehicle theft has become a major concern worldwide, necessitating the development of effective anti-theft systems. With advancements in technology, affordable and compact microcontrollers like the Raspberry Pi have emerged as a powerful platform for creating security and monitoring systems. This project focuses on designing a Vehicle Theft Detection System using a Raspberry Pi, aimed at providing real-time alerts and remote monitoring capabilities to enhance vehicle security.

The Raspberry Pi serves as the system's core processing unit, interfacing with various sensors such as GPS, accelerometers, and cameras to detect unauthorized access or movement of the vehicle. When suspicious activity is detected, the system can send notifications to the vehicle ownerâ€™s mobile device, providing live location tracking and optional image/video feeds. The integration of IoT (Internet of Things) enables remote access, allowing owners to monitor and secure their vehicles from anywhere. This solution offers an affordable, accessible, and effective method to safeguard vehicles from theft, making use of modern technology to tackle traditional security challenges.
